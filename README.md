# Salary Calculator


## Description

This is a form to take in data about employees - name, ID number, title, and annual salary - and display the data in a table. The salaries for all employees per month is calculated and shown in the corner. 

The goal is to create a dynamic form that can:
            -take in information through input fields
            -store that information
            -display that information on the DOM 
            -calculate monthly employee salary costs for all of the employees submitted
            -allow users to delete employees
            -accomplish these goals using jquery, javascript, html, and css.

Part of the stretch goals of the challenge are to:
            - add styling to the form 
            - remove salary information from the total cost when employees are deleted.
